      "I came here with a friend for happy hour around 4:00 or 5:00 on a weekday. The place was totally empty, so I chose a booth seat towards the back, though there's also bar seating for those that are interested. There was only one guy working there at the time (since there was a manageable crowd of one) and he took my drink order. I asked about which red wines were part of happy hour, and he said there was only one. How strange! Okay.  My friend eventually arrived and ordered the same sole happy hour red wine. We also got cheese and charcuterie platters to share. Those were tasty, and I would totally return just to have them again! The only downside is that we were in a rush to leave, and the place soon got busy after everyone else got off work, and the restaurant was suddenly understaffed with two people.  We had a challenge of getting the check, to the point where I had to get out of my seat to hunt down the waitress who was busy running around and was laser focused on her next task. I'll keep that mind next time, but I would definitely come back here now that my expectations are set. I like that it's conveniently located next to the Montgomery BART station.\n",
